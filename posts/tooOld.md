## Learning Data Science in Your 40s
I'm not starting from a complete lack of knowledge. I have a degree in theoretical physics, although that was 22 or so years ago. I know enough basic computer programming to put this website together and host it on Github. I have built various data dashboard using Excel and undertaken data analysis and reporting in my day job. I was even used K-means-squared to categorise some data and make reccomendations. But doing all this has only really whetted my appetite, and now in my 40s I want to delve deeper into this world of data science and see what I can learn and how I might apply it in future work.

## The Begining
This blog post is a kind of marker, a line in the sand of where it all began. There are no great pearls of wisdom here, only to say this is where the journey begins and I'll document here where it leads.
