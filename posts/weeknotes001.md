(It seems a little opptimistic starting my weeknotes number at 001, implying one day there might be 100 of them!)
## What I've been learning
- I've decided to try using Microsoft's new Loop app as a note taking and journal app for this learning journey. I've created a template for these weeknotes in the app whch will hopefully be useful for recording my thoughts. I've tried countless pieces of software for this type of work before, and see no reason why this should be any better, but thought I'd give it a try. As it is a new app there are already some limitations that are apparent, for example when reading an article on my phone that I might want to save there it no option to share it to Loop within the system menu, I need to go old school and copy&paste the link üôÅ.
- I tried to start learning SQL using [freeCodeCamp][fCC], but the tutorial kept failing/not updating my progress. I like what freeCodeCamp is about, but honestly I want to get on with learning not bug finding their training, so I gave up on that before I got going. I guess this is more of a what I haven't been learning!
- Microsoft has it's own [learning platform][MSLearn] - so I've selected a number of SQL related 'Learning Paths' to create my own learning journey. Hopefully this will work out better than my initial freeCodeCamp plan!
- Set theory is one of the mathematical foundations of the relational model of data management and is fundamental to working with relational databases. I vaguely remember something to do with Set theory from university, but a read of the [Wikipedia page][Set] was really helpful.


## What I've been watching
- A helpful introduction to [SQL][SQLintro]


## What I've been listening to
- This Town is a Sunday night BBC series which I enjoyed watching, but the [soundtrack][TT] is great fun
